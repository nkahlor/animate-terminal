# Version 1.0.0
Very bare bones at the moment, so far draw methods are only included for
triangles and boxes, the animation is set in stone as what it is for the
moment as well. The animations are based on positioning the cursor and
printing a character to the screen, then returning the cursor to the initial
position of the object (top-left) and rewriting the character in black, so
needless to say this will only work if your background is black, something I
intend to fix eventually. This was a project for a class taught in C++, but I
want to expand it so it can be used to make simple video games on the
terminal. The entire thing is based off of ANSI codes, so it is not compatible
with a windows machine, however it wouldn't be a challenge to make this
happen, as I based everything off of the <windows.h> library, some of the code
would merely have to be rewritten.
